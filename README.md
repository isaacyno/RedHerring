# Red Herring

Members: Derrick Chau, Andrew Choi, Isaac No

This final project was completed as a part of the course PIC16B - Python with Applications II - taken with professor Harlin Lee at UCLA during Winter quarter of 2023.

Our ultimate goal was to emulate the word game called Red Herring.

Here are some related links for the official game:

One can play our game by downloading the `red_herring-test` folder, navegating to this folder on the terminal, and typing `flask run`. 

A thorough description of this entire project can be read on [this](https://chauderrick.quarto.pub/derricks-blog/posts/redherring/) blog post.
